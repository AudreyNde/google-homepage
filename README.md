   - What are values?
   - What is the “query string” in a URL and what does it do?
   - What is the difference between “pixels” and “ems”?
   - How do CSS styles for a particular element get inherited? i.e. how does an element get its “default” styles?
   -  What are two CSS attributes you can change to push an element around on the page?
   - What are the three different ways to include CSS in your project or use CSS to style a particular element?
